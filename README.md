## Idea
This is an implementation of https://github.com/kleros/dapp-ideas/issues/21

Additionally, Proof of Humanity https://www.proofofhumanity.id will also be used. PoH verified users will enjoy better reliability score and will be given reductions in minimum staking required.

## Current code base
The current code base is for P2P video call with Metamask login. Users will be able to see if the other user is verified in Proof of Humanity. 

## Next release
In the next release, Kleros court api will be integerated. The users will have to deposit certain ETH to kleros court. If someone abuses the platform, the kleros court judiciary system will be called.
